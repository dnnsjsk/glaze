title: Syntax
---

The syntax of Glaze is straightforward and easy to understand. If you're
familiar with Tailwind, you'll find Glaze's approach very similar.

Animation strings are defined in the following order:

1. **Breakpoint** (optional)
2. **Selector** (optional)
3. **State** (required)
4. **Animation object** (required)

## Breakpoints

Breakpoints allow you to specify when an animation should run, based on the
breakpoints defined in the configuration. The breakpoint is defined using the
`@` symbol, followed by the breakpoint name.

```html copy
<div data-animate="@sm:from:opacity-0"></div>
```

## Selectors

By default, animations are applied directly to the element itself. However, you
can target other elements using selectors enclosed in brackets (`[]`) before the
state.

```html copy
<div data-animate="[&>h1]:to:opacity-1|stagger-0.25">
  <h1>...</h1>
  <h1>...</h1>
  <h1>...</h1>
</div>
```

The `&` symbol refers to the parent element, allowing you to specify a child
selector.

With media queries:

```html copy
<div data-animate="@sm:[&>h1]:to:opacity-1|stagger-0.25">
  <h1>...</h1>
  <h1>...</h1>
  <h1>...</h1>
</div>
```

## State

The animation state indicates the beginning and end points of the animation:

- **from**: The initial state of the animation.
- **to**: The final state of the animation.

```html copy
<div data-animate="from:opacity-0"></div>
<div data-animate="to:xPercent-50"></div>
```

If both states are defined, the animation will run from the initial state to the
final state. ([fromTo in GSAP](<https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/gsap.fromTo()/>))

```html copy
<div data-animate="from:opacity-0.5 to:opacity-1"></div>
```

## Animation object

The animation object specifies the properties to animate, following the state.

```html copy
<div data-animate="to:yPercent-10"></div>
```

The string is parsed by splitting at the dash (`-`), where the first part is the
property name, and the second part is its value. Values are automatically
converted to their appropriate type (`string`, `number`, or `boolean`).

### Chaining properties

To combine multiple properties in a single animation, separate them with a pipe
(`|`) character.

```html copy
<div data-animate="to:opacity-1|yPercent-10"></div>
```

### Nested objects

Access nested object properties by separating keys with a dot (`.`) character.

```html copy
<div data-animate="to:scale.x-2|scale.y-2"></div>
```

### Negative values

For negative values, enclose the value in brackets. (`[]`)

```html copy
<div data-animate="to:xPercent-[-50]"></div>
```

### Spaces

For values with spaces, use an underscore (`_`) character.

```html copy
<div data-animate="to:boxShadow-[0_0_50px_20px_red]"></div>
```
