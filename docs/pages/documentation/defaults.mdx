# Defaults

It is possible to set default values for timelines and elements using the
`defaults` option.

```js copy
glaze({
  defaults: {
    tl: "defaults:ease-power2.inOut",
    element: "to:x-500",
  },
});
```

Now, every timeline will use the `ease-power2.inOut` easing function and every
element will move to the left by 500 pixels.

Glaze creates a new timeline for each element by default, even if not marked
with `tl`. This means that the `tl` defaults option is perfect for applying
global defaults to all timelines and elements. (ScrollTrigger, ease etc.)
