# Selectors

By default, Glaze will search for elements with the `data-animate` attribute and
build the animation based on the value of the attribute. It is possible to
change the attribute during the initialization of the library.

```js copy
glaze({
  dataAttribute: "data-move",
});
```

## Classname

Alternatively, it is also possible to search for elements with a specific class
prefix. This is disabled by default.

```js copy
glaze({
  className: "animate",
});
```

Now Glaze will search for elements with the `animate-` class and build the
animation based on the value of those classes.

```html copy
<div data-animate="animate-from:opacity-0"></div>
```
